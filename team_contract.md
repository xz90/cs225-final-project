# CS 225 Data Structures 
## Team Contract (baoyul2-sxxiao2-zikuiw2-xz90) 

### Communication 
1. **Team Meetings** Our team will meet once a week every Friday (TBD) using Zoom. Each meeting may last approximately 2 hours to discuss the project progress, problems and improvement. Each member will rotate being the designated note-taker, starting with baoyul2, then sxxiao2, zikuiw2, and xz90. The note will be stored in Google Words. And we will also record our meeting and store the videos in a shared document. 

2. **Assistance** Each team member could contact each other using email, WeChat. Outside of emergencies or other special circumstances, we commit to respond within 24 hours.
 
3. **Respect** The note-taker for the week will also serve as the “project leader” for this week’s meeting. The project leader’s role is to ensure that each member of our group has the chance to state their opinions about a design decision and any other topic related with the final project. All decisions will be made by simple majority - unanimous agreement is preferred but not a requirement. By signing this document, each member of the team commits to adhering decisions made, even if they may personally disagree with some of the decisions.

### Collaboration 
1. **Work Distribution** We will determine necessary two equal deliverables every week based on our project progress and two team members work on one deliverable. The small teams will be assigned according to each one’s level of busyness each week. We will decrease someone’s workload if he/she has unexpected complications or unforeseen work, which should be informed before our meeting, and increase his/her workload the next week to balance the overall workload. 

2. **Time Commitment** To ensure an equal distribution of work, each member is expected to have independent work with no less than 2 and no more than 6 hours per week on the project. If a deliverable ends up taking more time, the rest of the team should be responsible for assisting with the unforeseen complication. Each member should take an equal share of the workload and programming in pairs. It is the team’s responsibility, not the individual’s responsibility, to make sure that a weekly deliverable is finished by the end of the week. If a team member cannot finish their tasks during the week because of special circumstances, they should be responsible for noticing others in advance.  However, if a team member is habitually or deliberately not completing their tasks, they may be asked - politely - to explain their circumstances. Based on their explanation, further actions may be taken, including alerting a staff member and may be taken on a case by case basis decided by the other team members.


3. **Conflict Resolution** When there is a disagreement between members, each one should explain his/her reasons and show the evidence to support his/her opinion. Then, each team member will vote to determine which method we will apply and each one should respect the voting result. If the vote is equal, we will consult our mentor for some suggestions. If someone has not accomplished their tasks or is habitually late, we will first have communication with him/her to let him/her know this issue. We will allow these mistakes to occur no more than three times, otherwise we will inform the course staff. 


If this was an MD file, each of us would sign our names here at the bottom with an electronic signature and a separate github commit over the same document.
