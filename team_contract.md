# CS 225 Data Structures
## Team Contract (rittika2-gcevans-xz33-atharva2)

### Communication
1. **Team Meetings** Our team will meet once a week every Tuesday from 5-7 PM using Zoom.
   Each member will rotate being the designated note-taker, starting with Rittika. Notes
   will be stored on a Google document, time-stamped for each meeting.
2. **Assistance** Each team member can be contacted through email ({rittika2, xz33, gcevans, atharva2}@illinois.edu), 
   Discord, or Slack. Outside of emergencies or other commitments, we commit to responding to emails within
   48 hours.
3. **Respect** The note-taker for the week will also serve as the "project lead" for the weekly meeting.
   Their role is to ensure that every member of the group has had a chance to speak or state their opinion
   about a design decision. However, design decisions can be accpted by simple majority - while unanimous 
   agreement is preferred, it is not required. Each member of the team commits to adhering to the decisions 
   made, even if they personally disagree with them.

### Collaboration
1. **Work Distribution** Each week, the necessary deliverables for the week will be determined by the full team
   and each member will volunteer to work on one or more deliverables. When no one volunteers, two team members
   will be randomly assigned the task.
2. **Time Commitment** Each member is expected to work no less than 2 and no more than 6 hours per week on the 
   project. If a deliverable ends up taking more time, the rest of the team should be pulled in to assist with 
   the unforeseen complication.
3. **Conflict Resolution** All conflicts within the team will be decided by a Super Smash Bros match, Final
   Destination 3 stock no items. The winner will decide who was right and who was wrong. (Might makes right.)
