# CS 225 Data Structures
## Development log (baoyul2-sxxiao2-zikuiw2-xz90)

**April 27(Tuesday)**

We organized a zoom meeting for cooperation. 

First, we check the previous code we wrote before and solve the problem in the BFS. 
The problem with the code I wrote before is: 
I use the id of each airport to represent each airport. 
However, when we use a limited number of airports to test, the vector will be out of bound.

Therefore, we changed to use iterator to represent the index of airport. This can solve the problem of out of bound.

Then, we decided that our next job is to complete the test cases of both Graph and BFS.
